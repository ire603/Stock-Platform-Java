# Stock-Application-Platform
Includes Screener (Intrinio), Real-time Stock Program (Based on IEXtrading4j Found on Github (WojciechZankowski)) and Database Set up With Mysql

There Are currently some bugs WIth The Screener And Live Stock Chart Due To Some Problems with Javax communication with the API's. 
But the platform runs. More than welcome to snag the code and make changes. Have fun.
